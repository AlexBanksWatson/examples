<h1>Capacitated network design problem</h1>

<h2>Problem Type</h2>
MIP (hard)

<h2>Keywords</h2>
Benders Decomposition, GMP, XML

<h2>Description</h2>
Network design problems deal with the selection of a subset of edges in
an existing network, such that for a set of commodities the given demand
for each commodity can be transported from its origin to its destination,
at minumum cost. In the capacitated network design problem the edges have
(fixed) capacities. Network design problems arise in telecommunications
and transportation planning.

The data of the instances are read using XML files.
