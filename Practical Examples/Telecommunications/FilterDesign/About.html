<h1>FIR filter design</h1>

<h2>Problem Type</h2>
SOCP (small)

<h2>Description</h2>
Minimax dB linear phase lowpass filter design. The problem is to find the
filter weights for a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. This model forms
an approximation by discretizing the frequency variable (omega) resulting
in a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. SOCP problems can be
solved by CPLEX and Gurobi.
