Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem

Problem type:
MIP (medium)

Keywords:
Incumbent callback, network object

Description:
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) deals with the distribution of goods between depots
and customers using vehicles. In the Capacitated VRP the vehicles have a limited
capacity. The model formulation in this project uses the three-index vehicle flow
model of Toth and Vigo (2002) denoted by VRP4 on pp. 15-16.

This project uses the data instance 'E-n23-k3' from the Christofides and Eilon
set on http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/
