<h2>AIMMS Examples</h2>

This page shows a list of AIMMS examples that are stored on GitHub. Each example contains the following three files:

<ul>
   <li> An About.txt file that briefly describes the model
   <li> An .aim file which is a text file containing the AIMMS model
   <li> An AIMMSpack file which contains all project file.
</ul>

The AIMMSpack file can only be opened in AIMMS 3.14 (or higher). For most examples the .aim file is sufficient; you can
create a new AIMMS project (might be AIMMS 3.13 or older) and then load the .aim file.
