{"name":"Examples","tagline":"","body":"GitHub stores a collection of AIMMS examples. Each example contains the following three files:\r\n\r\n* An About.txt file that briefly describes the model;\r\n* An .aim file which is a text file containing the AIMMS model;\r\n* An AIMMSpack file which contains all project file.\r\n\r\nThe AIMMSpack file can only be opened in AIMMS 3.14 (or higher). For most examples the .aim file is sufficient; you can\r\ncreate a new AIMMS project (might be AIMMS 3.13 or older) and then load the .aim file.\r\n\r\n* [Blending Problem](https://github.com/aimms/examples/tree/master/ChemicalEngineering/BlendingProblem/BlendingProblem.aim): LP (small)\r\n* [Chemical Equilibrium](https://github.com/aimms/examples/tree/master/ChemicalEngineering/ChemicalEquilibrium/ChemicalEquilibrium.aim): NLP (small)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
