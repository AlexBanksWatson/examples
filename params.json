{"name":"Examples","tagline":"","body":"AIMMS (an acronym for \"Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling System\") is a software system designed for modeling\r\nand solving large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems. It consists of an algebraic modeling language, an\r\nintegrated development environment for both editing models and creating a graphical user interface around these models,\r\nand a graphical end-user environment. AIMMS is linked to multiple solvers including CPLEX, Gurobi, MOSEK, CBC, Conopt,\r\nMINOS, IPOPT, SNOPT, KNITRO, BARON, LGO, Path and CP Optimizer.\r\n\r\nThe AIMMS website can be found at:\r\n\r\n   http://www.aimms.com\r\n\r\nThe AIMMS Google Group can be found at:\r\n\r\n   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aimms\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about AIMMS in general or about how to get the most out of AIMMS for your problem, you can ask\r\nthem here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis repository contains several AIMMS examples. Each example contains three files:\r\n\r\n* An About.txt file that briefly describes the model;\r\n* An .aim file which is a text file containing the AIMMS model;\r\n* An AIMMSpack file which contains all project file.\r\n\r\nThe AIMMSpack file can only be opened in AIMMS 3.14 (or higher). For most examples the .aim file is sufficient; you can\r\ncreate a new AIMMS project (might be AIMMS 3.13 or older) and then load the .aim file.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
