GitHub stores a collection of AIMMS examples. Each example contains the following three files:

* An About.txt file that briefly describes the model;
* An .aim file which is a text file containing the AIMMS model;
* An AIMMSpack file which contains all project file.

The AIMMSpack file can only be opened in AIMMS 3.14 (or higher). For most examples the .aim file is sufficient; you can
create a new AIMMS project (might be AIMMS 3.13 or older) and then load the .aim file.
