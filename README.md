AIMMS (an acronym for "Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling System") is a software system designed for modeling
and solving large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems. It consists of an algebraic modeling language, an
integrated development environment for both editing models and creating a graphical user interface around these models,
and a graphical end-user environment. AIMMS is linked to multiple solvers including CPLEX, Gurobi, MOSEK, CBC, Conopt,
MINOS, IPOPT, SNOPT, KNITRO, BARON, LGO, Path and CP Optimizer.
