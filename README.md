AIMMS (an acronym for "Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling System") is a software system designed for modeling
and solving large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems. It consists of an algebraic modeling language, an
integrated development environment for both editing models and creating a graphical user interface around these models,
and a graphical end-user environment. AIMMS is linked to multiple solvers including CPLEX, Gurobi, MOSEK, CBC, Conopt,
MINOS, IPOPT, SNOPT, KNITRO, BARON, LGO, Path and CP Optimizer.

This repository contains several AIMMS examples. Each example contains three files:

* An About.txt file that briefly describes the model;
* An .aim file which is a text file containing the AIMMS model;
* An AIMMSpack file which contains all project file.

The AIMMSpack file can only be opened in AIMMS 3.14 (or higher). For most examples the .aim file is sufficient; you can
create a new AIMMS project (might be AIMMS 3.13 or older) and then load the .aim file.
